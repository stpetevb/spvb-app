## 📋 Before You Deploy

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Complete)

- [ ] **Verify no sensitive files in Git**
  ```bash
  cd /Users/cameronlarmer/Documents/SPVB/spvb-app
  git ls-files | grep -E "(service-account|\.env)"
  ```
  ❌ If any files appear → Remove them and rotate credentials!
  ✅ If no files appear → You're good!

- [ ] **Test local build**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run preview
  ```
  ✅ Build succeeds and preview works → Ready to deploy!

- [ ] **Add environment variables to Vercel**
  - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
  - Add all `VITE_*` variables from `.env.local`
  - Set for: Production, Preview, Development

- [ ] **Update Firebase authorized domains**
  - Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
  - Add: `your-project.vercel.app` (or your custom domain)

---

### 🟡 RECOMMENDED (Should Complete)

- [ ] **Run security audit**
  ```bash
  npm audit
  ```
  - Fix any CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities
  - MODERATE and LOW can be addressed later

- [ ] **Test all legal pages**
  - [ ] Visit `/privacy` - loads correctly
  - [ ] Visit `/terms` - loads correctly
  - [ ] Visit `/waiver` - loads correctly (date now in footer)
  - [ ] Footer links work on all pages

- [ ] **Test admin access control**
  - [ ] Try accessing `/admin` without login → redirects to login
  - [ ] Log in with non-admin account → shows "Access denied"
  - [ ] Log in with admin account → accesses dashboard

- [ ] **Test registration flow**
  - [ ] Create test tournament
  - [ ] Register test team
  - [ ] Verify waiver checkbox is required
  - [ ] Verify phone number formatting works

---

### 🟢 OPTIONAL (Nice to Have)

- [ ] **Implement admin route protection** (15 min)
  - See: `OPTIONAL_ENHANCEMENTS.md` → Section 1
  - Prevents non-admin users from seeing admin UI

- [ ] **Enable 2FA for admin accounts** (5 min)
  - Firebase Console → Authentication → Multi-factor authentication
  - Adds extra security layer

- [ ] **Set up weekly npm audit** (2 min)
  - Add calendar reminder to run `npm audit` weekly
  - Keep dependencies secure

- [ ] **Have attorney review waiver** (optional)
  - Recommended for maximum legal protection
  - Focus on Florida enforceability
