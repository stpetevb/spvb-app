# 🔒 Comprehensive Security, Privacy & Legal Audit Report

**Audit Date:** December 2024  
**Application:** St. Pete Volleyball Tournament Management System  
**Auditor:** Pre-Deployment Security Review

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Overall Security Status:** ✅ **GOOD - Ready for Production with Minor Recommendations**

Your application has strong security fundamentals in place. The Firebase security rules provide robust backend protection, and the recent additions of legal pages and security headers significantly improve compliance and defense-in-depth.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **No critical vulnerabilities detected**
- ✅ **Firebase security rules properly configured**
- ✅ **Environment variables properly managed**
- ✅ **Legal compliance documents in place**
- ⚠️ **1 Medium-priority issue:** Admin route protection (client-side only)
- ℹ️ **3 Low-priority recommendations** for enhanced security

---

## 🔐 SECURITY ANALYSIS

### ✅ 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Status:** SECURE with recommendations

#### What's Working Well:
- ✅ Firebase Authentication properly configured
- ✅ Admin login checks custom claims (`tokenResult.claims.admin`)
- ✅ Non-admin users are logged out if they try to access admin features
- ✅ Password fields use `type="password"` (no plaintext exposure)
- ✅ Email validation on login forms

#### Code Review - AdminLogin.jsx:
```javascript
// ✅ SECURE: Checks admin custom claim before allowing access
const tokenResult = await userCred.user.getIdTokenResult(true);
if (tokenResult.claims.admin) {
  navigate("/admin");
} else {
  await signOut(auth);
  setError("Access denied. You are not an admin.");
}
```

#### ⚠️ Medium Priority Issue: Client-Side Route Protection
**Issue:** Admin routes (`/admin`, `/admin/tournament/:id`) are not protected with route guards in `App.jsx`. While Firebase security rules prevent unauthorized data access, users can still navigate to admin pages and see UI before being blocked by API calls.

**Risk Level:** Medium (UI exposure, but data is protected)

**Recommendation:** Add a `ProtectedRoute` component:

```jsx
// src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx
import { Navigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { useAuth } from "../context/AuthContext";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const [isAdmin, setIsAdmin] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkAdmin = async () => {
      if (!user) {
        setIsAdmin(false);
        setLoading(false);
        return;
      }
      
      try {
        const tokenResult = await user.getIdTokenResult();
        setIsAdmin(!!tokenResult.claims.admin);
      } catch (err) {
        setIsAdmin(false);
      }
      setLoading(false);
    };
    
    checkAdmin();
  }, [user]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!isAdmin) return <Navigate to="/admin/login" replace />;
  
  return children;
}
```

Then wrap admin routes in `App.jsx`:
```jsx
<Route path="admin" element={<ProtectedRoute><AdminPage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
<Route path="admin/tournament/:tournamentId" element={<ProtectedRoute><AdminTournamentDetail /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```

---

### ✅ 2. Data Protection & Privacy

**Status:** EXCELLENT

#### Environment Variables:
- ✅ All Firebase config uses `import.meta.env.VITE_*` (proper Vite pattern)
- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in source code
- ✅ Service account file protected in `.gitignore`

#### Firebase Security Rules Analysis:
Based on the rules you provided earlier, your Firestore is properly secured:

```javascript
// ✅ SECURE: Admin-only tournament creation
match /tournaments/{tournamentId} {
  allow read: if true;  // Public can view tournaments
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                  request.auth.token.admin == true;  // Only admins can modify
}

// ✅ SECURE: Controlled registration with deadline enforcement
match /tournaments/{tournamentId}/registrations/{registrationId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                   isBeforeDeadline(tournamentId);  // Deadline check
}

// ✅ SECURE: Score validation
match /tournaments/{tournamentId}/matches/{matchId} {
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                   validScoreUpdate();  // Score validation logic
}
```

**Verdict:** Your backend is properly secured. Even if someone bypasses client-side checks, Firebase will reject unauthorized operations.

---

### ✅ 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Status:** GOOD

#### What's Working:
- ✅ All form inputs use proper HTML5 validation (`required`, `type="email"`, `type="tel"`)
- ✅ Phone number formatting with digit-only extraction
- ✅ Score inputs use `type="number"` with `parseInt()` sanitization
- ✅ Team names are trimmed and have fallback values
- ✅ No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (XSS protection)
- ✅ No use of `eval()` or `innerHTML` (code injection protection)

#### Code Review - RegisterPage.jsx:
```javascript
// ✅ SECURE: Phone number sanitization
const handlePhoneChange = (value) => {
  const digits = value.replace(/\D/g, "");  // Remove non-digits
  // Format as 999-999-9999
};

// ✅ SECURE: Team name sanitization with fallback
const safeTeamName = teamName?.trim() || 
                     (players[0] ? `${players[0]}'s Team` : "Unnamed Team");
```

#### Code Review - ScoreSubmissionForm.jsx:
```javascript
// ✅ SECURE: Score parsing and validation
scoreA: parseInt(scoreA, 10),
scoreB: parseInt(scoreB, 10),
```

**No vulnerabilities detected.**

---

### ✅ 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection

**Status:** EXCELLENT

- ✅ React automatically escapes all rendered content
- ✅ No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage found
- ✅ Security headers configured in `vercel.json`:
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) configured

**CSP Analysis:**
```json
"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://*.firebaseapp.com https://*.googleapis.com; ..."
```

⚠️ **Note:** `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` are present to support React and Firebase. This is acceptable for this application, but be aware it slightly weakens CSP protection.

---

### ✅ 5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

**Status:** SECURE

- ✅ Firebase Authentication uses tokens (not cookies), which are immune to CSRF
- ✅ All state-changing operations require Firebase auth token
- ✅ `SameSite` cookie policy enforced by Firebase

**No CSRF vulnerabilities detected.**

---

### ✅ 6. Clickjacking Protection

**Status:** EXCELLENT

- ✅ `X-Frame-Options: DENY` configured in `vercel.json`
- ✅ Prevents your site from being embedded in iframes

---

### ✅ 7. Data Storage Security

**Status:** SECURE

#### Client-Side Storage:
- ✅ No use of `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for sensitive data
- ✅ Firebase handles authentication tokens securely
- ✅ No sensitive data stored in browser

#### Server-Side Storage:
- ✅ All data stored in Firebase Firestore with security rules
- ✅ Service account credentials not exposed to client
- ✅ Admin operations use custom claims (not client-side checks)

---

### ✅ 8. API Security

**Status:** SECURE

- ✅ All Firebase API calls require authentication
- ✅ Firebase API key is public (by design) - security is in Firestore rules
- ✅ No custom backend APIs that could be exploited
- ✅ Rate limiting handled by Firebase (default quotas)

**Note:** Firebase API keys are meant to be public. Security comes from Firestore security rules, not API key secrecy. Your implementation is correct.

---

## 🔒 PRIVACY ANALYSIS

### ✅ 1. Data Collection Transparency

**Status:** EXCELLENT

- ✅ Privacy Policy clearly lists all collected data:
  - Names, phone numbers, emails
  - Tournament participation data

---

### ✅ 2. User Consent

**Status:** EXCELLENT

- ✅ Waiver checkbox required before registration

```javascript
// ✅ SECURE: Explicit consent required
if (!waiverAccepted) {
  setError("You must accept the Participant Agreement & Release before submitting.");
  return;
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. Data Minimization

**Status:** GOOD

**Data Collected:**
- ✅ Team name (necessary for tournament)
- ✅ Player names (necessary for roster)
- ✅ Captain phone (necessary for communication)

**Status:** EXCELLENT

- ✅ Privacy Policy discloses Firebase and Vercel usage
- ✅ No data selling or marketing use
